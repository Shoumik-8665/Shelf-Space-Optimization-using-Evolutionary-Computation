# Shelf-Space-Optimization-using-Evolutionary-Computation
I was learning about Genetic Algorithm (GA) for a while now and suddenly thought that why don't I Identify a real world based problem and make a small project out of it! So as an IPE student, I thought from my point of view and came up with the idea which is "Shelf-Space Optimization using Evolutionary Computation".
